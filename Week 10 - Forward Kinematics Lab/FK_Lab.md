# Week 10 - UR3e Forward Kinematics

## Objectives

- Use forward kinematics (FK) to compute the pose of a UR3e robot arm's end effector.
- Determine where a laser pointer on the end effector intersects with a workbench at an arbitrary height.
- Publish commands to control the UR3e robot in ROS2 and visualize results.

## 1. Getting Started with the UR3e

- Power on the robot
- Release the brakes


2. Interfacing the Robot with PC

The robot connections and configuration has been setup. You have to interface the robot with ROS to receive and send comands.

- Find the `commands2run.txt` file on the Desktop
- Follow instructions in the file to get the robot interfaced with ROS


## 2. Modify the FK script to move the robot

# Week 7 - UR3e Inverse Kinematics on Gazebo

## Objectives

The objective of this lab is to derive and implement a solution to the inverse kinematics problem for the UR3 robot. In this lab we will:

- Derive elbow-up inverse kinematic equations for the UR3
- Write a publisher that moves the UR3 to a point in space specified by the user
